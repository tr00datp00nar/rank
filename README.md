# ðŸŒ³ Rank

This is a small cli tool that uses a binary insertion algorithm to help the user rank items in a list. I have put it into a command branch for inclusion into my c Bonzai stateful command tree.

If you just want to try it out, grab the release binary with curl and put into your PATH:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/rank/releases/latest/download/rank-linux-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/rank
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/rank/releases/latest/download/rank-darwin-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/rank
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/rank/releases/latest/download/rank-darwin-arm64 -o ~/.local/bin/rank
curl -L https://github.com/tr00datp00nar/rank/releases/latest/download/rank-windows-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/rank
```
