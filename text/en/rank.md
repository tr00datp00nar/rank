CLI tool for creating and ranking lists

Prompts the user to enter list items one-by-one. Press enter to save a list item. When the list is complete, pass an empty list item to end the loop. The program will ask you to rank each list item and will sort the list based on your responses. Uses a binary insertion sorting algorithm.
